# Courseera-Review-NLP-Project
We evaluated five different machine learning models on a Course Era Review dataset, and the results showed that the vectorization and bag of words strategies produced good accuracy levels. We used the decision tree, random forest, KNN, logistic regressiontechniques. For each model, we have optimized the performance using hyperparameter tuning.

We used the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method for the vectorization technique and the Count Vectorization for the bag of words method. The model trained using the vectorization strategy with the highest accuracy was Gradient Boosting (75%) The model trained using the BOW method with the highhest accuracy was Logistic Regression(75%)
